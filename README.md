# SitePipe Starter Template

This is a minimal starting point, for a more complex example see the [Blog
Example](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/SitePipe/tree/master/examples/blog)

You can build this site using stack: `stack build && stack exec build-site`

Here's a few steps you could take:

- Try editing templates inside the `site` directory
- Try serving the built site using something like [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
    - `npm install -g serve`
    - `serve dist/`
- Read the docs on the [Github Page](https://github.com/chrispenner/sitepipe)
- Try adding a few more posts!
- Add some CSS or JS to your site!
- Try hosting your built site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!
