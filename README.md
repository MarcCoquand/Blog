# Marc Coquand's Personal Website

My personal website, developed using CSS, HTML, Tachyons, Haskell and SitePipe.
To build it you will need [Stack](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&q=haskell+stack)
and you can serve it locally using [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).
To build simply run:

```
stack build 
stack exec build-site
```
