                <p>Let me first start of with stating that I love a lot of things in Haskell. The declarative and functional style added with purity makes for an amazing and beautiful language. Learning Haskell was also an enlightening experience with a lot of aha moments. A lot of what I have learnt I will be able to use in other languages. However with all of that said there is an excessive amount of complexity, followed by poor explanations and so much to learn that it becomes too much to be worth it all.</p>
<p>So I enrolled in a course at university for functional programming . There we learnt everything from the basics up to type classes, Functor, Applicative, Monad and ended at State transformers and parsers. All was good. The concepts were not so hard and allowed me to write some clean and elegant code. Now that I felt I had learnt Haskell I wanted to use all my newly acquired knowledge to create something cool with it. I decided I was going to make a web app. Suddenly I was going to be introduced to the world that is real life Haskell.</p>
<pre><code>{-# language OverloadedStrings #-}
module Main where

import SitePipe

indexContext :: [Value] -&gt; Value
indexContext posts = 
    object 
        [ &quot;posts&quot; .= posts
        , &quot;url&quot; .= (&quot;/index.html&quot; :: String)
        ]

-- | All the static assets can just be copied over from our site&#39;s source
staticAssets :: SiteM ()
staticAssets = 
    copyFiles [ &quot;css/&quot; ]

main :: IO ()
main = 
    site $ 
        do  posts &lt;- resourceLoader markdownReader [&quot;posts/*.md&quot;]

            staticAssets
            writeTemplate &quot;templates/index.html&quot; [indexContext posts]
            writeTemplate &quot;templates/post.html&quot; posts</code></pre>
<p>Jesus that is overwhelming. Turns out that there is something called language extensions and there is a ton of them that you have to learn if you want to read others code because they are used everywhere. I had never seen them up to this point. After learning all 9 of the ones above I still had not learnt all that I would need to learn to use this library. This is just the baseline to start to understand this library. And many of these extensions do not have more than maybe an article and some blog post as documentation. Some of the extensions are there to fix issues with the language itself. Such OverloadedStrings to fix the poor default implementation of String as a list of Chars. So I thought after learning the nine extensions I listed above that I would be ready to start to use the library. Turns out that it was not enough because then you have extensions like TemplateHaskell and Quasiquoters which is kinda Haskell’s answer to Lisp macros and allows you to do metaprogramming. This adds an entire new layer of syntax and makes your code way harder to debug if you manage to generate expressions that do not compile. Suddenly one of the main advantages of Haskell which is it’s super useful compiler is gone. Template Haskell adds a lot of voodoo magic making it hard to know what is going on.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some of these extensions just add some esoteric stuff to make your code look cooler. For example LambdaCase allows you to write:</p>
