title: Software development reading list
author: Marc Coquand
---

Reading list for software development. The list strives to be as language
agnostic as possible as a good developer is flexible. Lots of talks and
papers use Elm and Haskell but the techniques apply to any language. My interest
is in creating software that is correct in a reasonable time scale and so this
list represent that.

### Books in Software Engineering

- Robert Cecil Martin - Clean Code
- Jean Raymond Abrial - Modeling in Event-B. When learning about property-based
  testing I found it difficult to find invariants. This books introduces a
  structured way to build software that also finds the invariants to test.
- C.J. Date - Database Design and Relational Theory
- Chris Okasaki - Purely Functional Data Structures
- Scott Wlaschin - Domain Modeling Made Functional
- Sandy Maquire - Thinking with Types
- [Bartosz Milewski - Category Theory for
  Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf)
- Ben-Ari Mordechai - Mathematical logic for computer science
- Fredrick Brooks - The Mythical Man Month

### Thought-provoking

- [Testing Microservices, the Sane
  Way](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-microservices-the-sane-way-9bb31d158c16)
- [I’m harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site. Here’s
  how.](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5<Paste>). In Elm this problem is highly mitigated due to the
  separation between pure and impure code and low dependency list.
- [F# Code I Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLxyyTF3OM) - "350000 C# code
  developed over 5 years by 8 people was then translated into 30000
  F# code in less than one year by (at most) 3 people. 3000 null checks in the C#
  project and 15 in the F# one."

### Personal management

After reading Deep work it makes me wonder if Slack and open work spaces is
preferable to email and offices?
