Arriving in Vietnam is a breath of hot, dirty air. It seems that I have ended up
in crazy town. Mixed with the beautiful fauna is a smog so dense it fills up
your lungs and makes you wonder how many years you give up by being here. After
being asked twice if I want to hook up by strangers, not hookers, I begin to
wonder what my place here is. A part of me gets the impression that they hate
foreigners here, like most countries hate foreigners, another part of me gets
the impression that they fetishize me. 

One thing I love about the city is the entrepreneurial spirit of the people
here. Everyone seems to be doing freelance gigs, run a store or something else.
Maybe it is the recovery from the wars, making this generation responsible for
reviving the city and bringing vietnamese economy back. Maybe it is something
exclusive for Ho Chi Minh. I do not know.
